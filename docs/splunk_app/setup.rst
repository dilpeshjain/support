Check that HTTP Event Collector is enabled
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you haven’t created any tokens and this is your first time using the Event Collector 
you have to ensure that the HTTP Event Collector is enabled before continuing.

1. Use the link provided in the success message to go directly to the **Data Inputs** page.

2. Click on HTTP Event Collector again.

3. Check the status (far right column) of the token you just created in the previous 
   section. If it is “enabled” then you are ready for the next step. If not, click the 
   **Global Settings** button.

   and display created Event Buffers and Data Sources.
