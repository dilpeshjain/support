Falkonry Concepts
=================

Here's a quick overview of the basic elements of the Falkonry Service and concepts that
are referenced elsewhere in the documentation.

The Falkonry Service is used to extract a real-time understanding of condition from patterns in time series data. The most common use of the Falkonry Service is to provide intelligence to applications that are monitoring some Entity or set of Entities.  
	   
Entities
------

Entities are what they sound like - anything (e.g. an appliance, a device, a vehicle, a 
machine, a person) that produce a stream of data through its operation.

Signals
-------

Time series data is represented in the Falkonry Service as a set of Signals. Each Signal represents a sequence of values over time that can be indexed by Entity.  Signals can carry either numerical or categorical values.

Conditions
----------

Conditions are what we are trying to extract from patterns found in time series data. This is typically a measure of the state of some Entity. Conditions could be used to represent health, operating mode, risk or threat level, quality level, or almost any form of condition assessment. 

Falkonry can also recognize two other conditions - *Unknown* and *Gap*.

**Unknown**

While a pipeline is monitoring the inflow or merely running a test revision, any new patterns that arise which were not seen when the pipeline was learning will be reported as the unknown condition. An unknown condition is displayed on the timeline alongside other condition labels. 

If a fact is added about that pattern, then Falkonry learns from it and replaces the unknown condition with the provided fact.

**Gap**

Ordinarily unevenly sampled data is automatically handled in Falkonry. However, if there is long period of time during which any of the input signals has no data samples, then the assessment for such a period is reported as a gap condition and it is displayed on the UI with other assessment condition labels after learning. 

Facts
-----------------------

A fact is a known condition for a particular episode of time.  Facts can come from external sources, inspection reports, or investigations.  Facts data typically becomes available after events have passed.

Learning
--------

The Falkonry Service is able to *Learn* a condition model from signal data and any condition facts.  The Falkonry Service is able to perform unsupervised, semi-supervised, and supervised learning on the supplied data to create a condition model.  When no condition facts are present, the model will recognize conditions and assign machine generated names. Facts aid learning, but there is no minimum numbers of facts that need to be supplied.  The Falkonry Service uses a continuous learning approach where models are revised over time as more signal data and facts are received.

Recognition
-----------

The application of a model to signal data to produce a condition assessment is called *Recognition*. The Falkonry Service supports real-time condition recognition on signal data.

Event Buffers and Pipelines
---------------------------

The Falkonry Service uses two primary building blocks - *Event Buffers* and *Pipelines*.

**Event Buffer**

An *Event Buffer* is a logical or physical holding area in Falkonry for the operational data
being analyzed for patterns. An event buffer can receive data from a variety of sources,
both external and internal. External sources can be Falkonry connectors such as OSISoft PI,
Splunk, Azure IoT Hub, PubNub, and Falkonry client libraries such as for JavaScript, C#,
and Python. The only internal source that brings data into an event buffer is a pipeline,
described below, whose outflow can be dumped into an event buffer.

As operational data arrives in an event buffer, it is saved and available for use in
existing pipelines connected to the event buffer as well as for any future pipelines
created from the event buffer. 

**Pipeline**

A *Pipeline* is the basic organizing unit in the Falkonry Service.  A pipeline receives
data from an event buffer and this data flow is referred to as *Inflow*.  The output that 
is produced by the pipeline is referred to as *Outflow*.  In addition to Inflow/Outflow, a 
Pipeline also consumes *Facts* data in form of known conditions. 

A Pipeline is what a user interacts with when using the Falkonry Service. The Pipeline provides a stream of condition predictions in exchange for a stream of signal data from Entities.

When a pipeline is first created, it has no model and cannot produce any outflow. Once the pipeline is supplied signal data it can learn a model with whatever fact data is available - even none. Once this model is available, the pipeline can be Opened and condition assessments will flow out of the pipeline. A pipeline can carry out a process of continuous improvement by generating a sequence of improved model and ‘hot-swapping’ those models into the real-time assessment flow.
