Distributed Deployment
======================

A private deployment of Falkonry can be made into an Infrastructure-as-a-Service provider
such as Microsoft Azure or Google Container Engine. It is also possible to provide a 
private deployment of Falkonry in your own data center or rack.

System requirements
-------------------

Any deployment of Falkonry should be sized appropriate to the data rate, maximum number
of signals per pipeline, and the number of pipelines. The minimum suggested hardware for
use with Falkonry is the following:

- Hardware 

  - VM and bare metal instances are supported
  - For a distributed deployment of Falkonry Service, minimum of

      - 4 nodes with 4 full cores and 64 GB RAM each
      - 256 GB attached SATA for root volumes
      - 1 TB SSD for learning buffer volumes
      - 128 GB SSD for internal database volumes

- Software 

  - `Kubernetes v1.1 <http://kubernetes.io/v1.1/gs-custom.html>`_ including 
    `kubectl <http://kubernetes.io/v1.0/docs/user-guide/kubectl/kubectl.html>`_
    The VMs can run any operating systems as long as Kubernetes is fully supported.
  - Falkonry installer is downloaded from the `Falkonry Partner Website <http://falkonry.com/partners>`_. It is 
    named as `Falkonry-k8-installer.zip` file. 
  - To execute the installer script, you will need a shell environment such as `bash` or `tcsh`.  
  
- Network
 
  - Outbound access to the Internet is required to perform installation.
  - Inbound access for Falkonry DHCS through a jump box

Preparing to Install Falkonry
-----------------------------

Make sure Kubernetes is running and a cluster has been created. Also, ensure that you can
reach the Kubernetes cluster using ``kubectl``. You can confirm this by performing the 
following steps::

  $ kubectl get services
  $ kubectl get rc

Also, before executing the next step, complete the following:
  
- Obtain the following from Falkonry:

  - Software repository credentials for downloading Falkonry Service.
  - Splunk HTTP Event Collector Token for deployment health monitoring.
  - Splunk credentials for application logging.

- Every instance that is part of the Kubernetes cluster will have to login to Falkonry's
  software repository using credentials from the previous step. The command will look like
  the following where the ``-u`` and ``-p`` values will be the credentials provided to you::
  
    docker login -e="." -u="falkonry+installer" \
    -p="9496DSFLGKJ49TS5MGZNW8MK5SDWZDIAKC003ZR8SM71B03UUIVAVOSC66F7S" quay.io
- Decide the configuration for the following properties:

  - External host name
  - External host protocol such as ``http`` or ``https``

- Create a DNS entry for your selected host name and map it to the IP address for the
  Kubernetes host.
  
- Map externally accessible ports to the Falkonry UI Server port ``30061``. You can use 
  Apache or another Web server for this purpose.

  - If you are using the ``http`` protocol in the previous step, you will need to proxy
    from port ``80`` to port ``30061``. 
  - If you are using the ``https`` protocol in the previous step, you will need to proxy
    from port ``443`` to port ``30061``. 

You should run the Falkonry installer from the environment that has access to Kubernetes
as confirmed in the previous step. Also, run the installation scripts from the folder 
where you opened the Falkonry Installer.

Executing the Falkonry Installer
--------------------------------

The installation script is run with the following command::

  $ ./install.sh -c=medium -h=falkonry.acme.com -p=http -k=kubernetes-token \
  -t=splunk-token -u=splunk-user -s=splunk-password
  
The full usage documentation of this installer script is as follows::

  Example : install.sh -c=medium -h=falkonry.acme.com -p=https -k=kube-secret -t=1234567890 -u=username -s=secret
    -c | --clusterType   : Cluster type - only medium is supported at the moment.
    -h | --host          : Falkonry host to be used. Example - falkonry.acme.com.
    -p | --protocol      : Host protocol to be used - http or https.
    -k | --kubeToken     : Kubernetes authentication token.
    -t | --token         : Splunk token to be used. This is provided by Falkonry.
    -u | --username      : Splunk username to be used. This is provided by Falkonry.
    -s | --password      : Splunk password to be used. This is provided by Falkonry.

Post-Installation Steps
-----------------------

If you have prepared correctly for the installation, then once the installation is 
completed, you will be able to open the URL for your host in a regular browser to bring up
Falkonry. For example, if your configured host were ``falkonry.acme.com`` and configured 
host protocol is ``http``, then just type ``http://falkonry.acme.com`` to start using
your private deployment of the Falkonry Service.

Upgrading Falkonry software
---------------------------

This script installs upgraded software and updates configuration changes used by Falkonry.
It must be used with the same credentials provided by Falkonry as used during installation.
The upgrade script is run with the following command::

  $ ./upgrade.sh -c=medium -h=falkonry.acme.com -p=http -k=kubernetes-token \
  -t=splunk-token -u=splunk-user -s=splunk-password

The full usage documentation of this update script is as follows::

  Example : upgrade.sh -c=medium -h=falkonry.acme.com -p=https -k=kube-secret -t=1234567890 -u=username -s=secret
    -c | --clusterType   : Cluster type - only medium is supported at the moment.
    -h | --host          : Falkonry host to be used. Example - falkonry.acme.com.
    -p | --protocol      : Host protocol to be used - http or https.
    -k | --kubeToken     : Kubernetes authentication token.
    -t | --token         : Splunk token to be used. This is provided by Falkonry.
    -u | --username      : Splunk username to be used. This is provided by Falkonry.
    -s | --password      : Splunk password to be used. This is provided by Falkonry.

Uninstalling Falkonry software
------------------------------

Uninstalling the Falkonry software will stop the Kubernetes services and remove the Falkonry software.
The script does not remove any of the data created using Falkonry. The uninstall script is simply run 
with the following command::

  $ ./uninstall.sh
