User Guide
==========
When you login to a Falkonry Server for the first time, you will see a screen that looks like the following.

.. image:: images/falkonry_datastreams.png

In the left hand navigation panel, you will see links to the two primary functional areas of the UI - Datastreams & Account Management - and a link to this help documentation.
The third link provides documentation on how to use the Falkonry PI Integration agent to work with OSIsoft's Asset Framework.
