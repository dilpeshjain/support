Live Monitoring and Continued Learning 
--------------------------------------

From the `Configure <./configure.html>`_ tab, the user can choose to **Open** the Outflow, in which case the most 
recent model revision is used to assess conditions in any existing or newly arriving data.
The user can alternatively choose a model first whereby the choice of available revisions
is presented for use to **Open** the outflow.

As soon as the user opens the outflow, live monitoring starts and assessments are produced
at the rate at which data arrives into the pipeline.  At any time, the user can initiate a
model revision and update the model used for live monitoring so that predictions can 
continue to improve.
