Falkonry ADK
============

Welcome to the Falkonry Integrator API! 

You can use our API to create, ingest and extract information from various datastreams, assessments, and facts (ground truths). The API also allows the user to generate output for historical data, set/ get metadata for entities as well as toggle datastreams on/ off.

We have language bindings in Java, C#, Python and Shell (coming soon)!
